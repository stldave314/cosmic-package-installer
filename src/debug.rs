//! Build-time diagnostic logging.
//!
//! This application spends most of its time driving external tools (`dpkg-deb`,
//! `apt-get`, `flatpak`) and talking to PackageKit over D-Bus. When something
//! goes wrong the interesting detail is *which* command ran and what it said,
//! and that is far too noisy for stderr — which in a desktop-launched app is
//! usually discarded anyway. Everything here goes to a file instead.
//!
//! Logging is gated on the [`ENABLED`] constant so it can be compiled out
//! entirely: when it is `false` the `debug_log!` macro's body is unreachable and
//! the optimiser removes it, leaving no formatting cost and no file I/O. The
//! arguments are still type-checked either way, so disabled call sites can't rot.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! debug_log!(DEB, "control fields parsed: {}", fields.len());
//! ```
